        Hey! I'm <strong>Kyle Hill</strong>, a developer that got roughly half of a traditional, academic CS background who's taught himself most of what he's had to professionally over the past decade. I've worked in everything from MUMPS to Java to .NET to Ruby, but have focused by and large on JavaScript for most of that time. If you asked for my macro-economic competitive advantage, I'd probably go with something like "creating precise and maintainable interfaces," but I'm happy to work with any technology, anywhere in the stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up on Long Island (it's a great place to be <em>from</em>) but live in Washington, DC with my wife, our garbage cat, and our other, slightly less garbage cat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>kylehill</strong> on everything that matters, and <strong>kylf</strong><a href="#note-kylf" name="back-kylf"><sup>[1]</sup></a> on everything that doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limited examples of my development work are on <a href="//github.com/kylehill" target="_blank">GitHub</a>; abundant examples of retweeted baseball jokes and failed <em>bon mots</em> are available on <a href="//twitter.com/kylehill" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can usually find me procrastinating with the cool kids on the 
        <a href="//www.dctechslack.com/" target="_blank">DC Tech</a> and
        <a href="//wealljs.org/" target="_blank">WeAllJS</a> Slack organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to <a href="mailto:kylehill@gmail.com">reach out</a> - I'm happy to consider both full-time and freelance opportunities at this time. While I'm happy to work as part of a remote team, and don't mind occasional travel, I'm not looking to relocate.

        You know how they give you those Scantron bubble sheets for standardized exams? Right, well, I filled out my name wrong when I took the SAT, and I've got a little brother who delighted in taking the piss for the following year of college marketing mail that all came addressed to "Kylf."
